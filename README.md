# Solaris - A 3D interactive, audiovisual solar system

This project was made during the month of February 2024 as my entry for Bruno Simon's Discord challenge. The theme was "Solar System".

The sun and each planet are shaded procedurally using a `PlanetMaterial` I created, the only "hard" assets present in the scene are the eight audio loops assigned to the planets.
